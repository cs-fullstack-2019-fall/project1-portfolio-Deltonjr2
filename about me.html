<div id="title" Why here why now></div>
<p id="explain">On at hectic Sunday Morning while getting ready for church and listening to my favorite radio segment "The Pulse". I heard a interesting topic regarding software coding and how Memphis has now created a Nonprofit organization that allows adults to learn software coding with "no previous experience." This sounded like such an innovative idea, it was especially enticing since I have a special passion for working in the community, and my position with a local bank was recently eliminated via a downsize initiative.

    I was excited! Code Crew sounded like a fabulous idea. It was a great way to get back in the community and to learn a new skill which would allow me to  endoctrinate back into the community and the workforce!

    Code Crew has meet all my expectations. I have now learned to think logically and how to manipulate data in a positive manner. I have learned that hard work and dedication will lead to success no matter how hard the task. I look forward to continuing my journey into the coding world. Thanks Code Crew!</p>
